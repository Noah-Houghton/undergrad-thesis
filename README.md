## "'Gone looking' for female Viking warriors": Reimagining Viking Gender and Sexuality Through Michael Hirst's *Vikings*
### Undergraduate Thesis by Noah Houghton

As an undergraduate at Harvard College, I wrote and submitted a thesis as part of completing my degree. In my thesis, I explore the ways in which Michael Hirst's popular television series *Vikings* uses modern scholarship to rehabilitate the ahistorical image of the Viking Age Scandinavian as simple, brutish, and misogynist into something which is both more accurate but also queerer and more feminist than any prior media representation.
